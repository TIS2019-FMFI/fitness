# How to install backend 

We recommended to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) on your local machine and also installed [Harbor](https://github.com/BRACKETS-by-TRIAD/harbor-installer).

If you have installed Docker and Harbor you should follow [Harbor Documentation](https://github.com/BRACKETS-by-TRIAD/harbor-installer).
